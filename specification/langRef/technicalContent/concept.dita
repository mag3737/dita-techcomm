  <shortdesc><draft-comment author="BobThomas">This shortdesc is entirely usage information. As
      such, its content ought to be moved into the Usage information section. In its place we should
      say something like: "The concept element is a topic-level element that models the semantics of
      the concept information type."</draft-comment>The <xmlelement>concept</xmlelement> element is
    the top-level element for a topic that answers the question <q>what is?</q> Concepts provide
    background information that users must know before they can successfully work with a product or
    interface. Often, a concept is an extended definition of a major abstraction such as a process
    or function. It might also have an example or a graphic, but generally the structure of a
    concept is fairly simple.</shortdesc>
